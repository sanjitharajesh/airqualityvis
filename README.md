An interactive dashboard application using Plotly in R to analyze air quality data in Indian cities.

In this project, I leveraged R and the Plotly library to conduct a comprehensive analysis of air quality data in Indian cities. The focal point is an organized and interactive dashboard containing over 15 diverse visualizations, including violin plots, heatmaps, and 3D visualizations. These visuals provide in-depth insights into the relationships embedded in the dataset, offering a nuanced understanding of air quality dynamics.
